# VT Git Workshop 2024

Welcome to the VT mentorship git workshop for 2024 cohort ;))

## Goals

We will work together on our very first repository! If this is your first time
using Git in a team setting, you will have some exposure, after the workshop,
with:

1. Working with multiple teams concurrently.
2. Collaborating within a small team.
3. Making PRs and resolving merge conflicts.

## Instructions

We will pretend to be a very small scale software company. You will split into
several groups, and each group will make changes to a unique file:

- Group 1: Phuong Le, Hai Nam, Thuc Anh, Huu Khang, Ba Quan, Trang Vu
- Group 2: Ngoc Anh, Tri Hoang, Thang Nguyen, Quynh Tran, Van Nguyen
- Group 3: Giang Pham, Truong Vien, Hai Anh, Huy Hoang, Minh Hung
- Group 4: Long Dau, Thuy Vy, Khanh Linh, Trang Linh, Phan Anh, Thanh Nguyen
- Group 5: Phuc Khang, Quy Nguyen, Vy Tran, Linh Nguyen, Duy Kha, Trang Do

1. Clone the repository.
2. Checkout branch `whoami`.
3. Create a new branch `<username>/whoami`.
4. In the repository, there are 5 files for each group. Find the file for your
   group and add your school and a fun fact about you.
5. Commit and push your changes.
6. Create a PR.
7. You will notice on that there are merge conflicts. Resolve the conflicts
   and merge your branch in.
